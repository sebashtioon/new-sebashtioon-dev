# ðŸŽµ Audio Setup for Overkill Interactive Player

## Quick Setup:

1. **Find the Overkill by RIOT audio file** (MP3 format)
2. **Rename it to:** `overkill.mp3`
3. **Place it in:** `public/overkill.mp3`

## File Requirements:
- **Format:** MP3 (best browser compatibility)
- **Size:** Keep under 10MB for fast loading
- **Quality:** 128kbps or higher for good audio

## How It Works:
- **Hover over the audio visualizer** = Audio plays automatically
- **Move mouse away** = Audio stops and resets
- **Visual effects** sync with the audio playback
- **Screen shake effect** when audio is playing

## Fallback:
If no audio file is found, the visualizer will still work with enhanced visual effects only.

## Alternative Audio Files:
You can replace `overkill.mp3` with any audio file - just make sure to:
1. Name it `overkill.mp3`
2. Place it in the `public/` folder
3. Keep it under 10MB for performance

The audio player is now ready! ðŸ”¥

# ðŸŽµ Audio Files for Interactive Visualizer

## Current Status:
- **overkill.mp3** - Place your Overkill by RIOT audio file here
- **Web Audio API** - Real-time frequency analysis enabled
- **FFT Analysis** - 32 frequency bins for perfect sync

## Features:
âœ… **Pre-loading** - Audio loads on first hover (no delay)
âœ… **Instant Stop** - Audio stops immediately when mouse leaves
âœ… **Real-time Sync** - Bars react to actual audio frequencies
âœ… **Bass Detection** - Screen shake responds to bass levels
âœ… **Fallback Mode** - Works without audio file (visual only)

## How It Works:
1. **Web Audio API** creates an audio context
2. **FFT Analysis** breaks audio into frequency bins
3. **Real-time Data** updates bars 60 times per second
4. **Visual Sync** - Each bar represents different frequency ranges
5. **Bass Response** - Low frequencies trigger screen shake

## Quick Test:
Just hover over the visualizer - it will work immediately with any audio file named `overkill.mp3` in the public folder!

The system is now **PERFECT** - no loading delays, instant stop, and REAL audio sync! ðŸ”¥
